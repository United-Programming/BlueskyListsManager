# Bluesky Lists Manager

It is an abpplication developed with Flutter and Dart language using Bluesky APIs.
You can get started here: [atprotodart.com](https://atprotodart.com/)

## Structure of the code
All the code is in a single class called `main.dart`

All images are in the `assets/images` folder.

Each page of the application is generated by a single widget class. Each widget has its own dart code to implement the function of the page.

## What this application does
Once you login with your Bluesky handle and app password, you can then manage your Bluesky lists.

You can write only in your own lists, but you can read from any list you want.

You can count the users in a list, you can merge two lists, you can delete all the content of a list, and you can add to a list all people listed in a Starter Pack.

You can then add and remove quicly people to a list, without the need of waiting minutes in case te list becomes big.
You can also block and unblock people in a list (this is useful in case you maintain a block list and you wish to check one person later, you can just deblock the pesron, check it again, and decide to keep or remove it from a list.)

The application is released with 4 skins (Light, Dark, NAFO, and Ukraine.)

## License
This project is completely free and it is distributes under Creative Commons license.
- It can compile for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- It may work also on Android but I did not try it.

There are no releases added here, you can compile on your own.If you want, I can build for Linux for you as long you show me a receipt of a donation helping Ukraine (any amount.)

## Credits
The whole app was developed and build by myself.
